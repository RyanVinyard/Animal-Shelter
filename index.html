  <p>This is Prince Michael. He is a very sad but friendly cat. He loves to play with yarn because he is an idiot. Please bring him to a loving home because we hate him. Also we keep tripping on all his yarn.<img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kWBSqH_6Hwo/UHYHEElERrI/AAAAAAAAFZg/DLNyyjSIR3w/s1600/SAD-CA1.jpg" alt="A very sad cat named Prince Michael"></p>

  <p>This is the goose named Bruce. He made truce with a moose, but got kicked in the papoose. He lives in a sluice, he loves to drink juice, if he tries to get loose, we'll give him the noose.</p>

  <p>Look at this sad falcon who also goes by the name Harvey Birdman. He's so sad he barely even has eye sockets. He just slammed his head into a building and now he has a boo-boo. Have your gloves ready!<img src="http://i551.photobucket.com/albums/ii452/bluecynder/sad-bird.jpg" alt="A sad bird named Harvey Birdman"> </p>

  <p>This is an Axlotl. Do you even know what an Axlotl is? It's not a Pokemon, but it is cute. His name is Vegeta. Please do not hit him or squish him. Also, he made this face too much and now it's stuck like this.
