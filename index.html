    <p>This is Prince Michael. He is a very sad but friendly cat. He loves to play with yarn because he is an idiot. Please bring him to a loving home because we hate him. Also we keep tripping on all his yarn.</p>

    <p>Look at this sad falcon who also goes by the name Harvey Birdman. He's so sad he barely even has eye sockets. He just slammed his head into a building and now he has a boo-boo. Please adopt him, and get your gloves ready for us to send him off.</p>

  <div class="column3">
    <p>This is the goose named Bruce. He lives in a sluice, he loves to drink juice, if he tries to get loose, we'll give him the noose.</p>
